          This project provides rewards to users of a website based on the
          actions they perform within the website. These may include posting,
          commenting, like or disliking among others. Based on the number of
          points a user has, the website will allow Role-Based Access Control
          (RBAC) to the user automatically assigning users moderator access.
          This access will allow a moderator to edit posts and delete comments.
